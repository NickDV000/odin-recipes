My first project at the foundations course

- Hi, I’m @NickDV000

- I’m currently learning about HTML in the course of The Odin Project; this is my first project in the course.
- During this project, I've used my knowledge about links, images, text management with the different levels of a heading, and the correct way to make a commit.
- I should mention that English isn`t my mother tongue; therefore, some of the commits or paragraphs can be without perfect redaction or have incorrect vocabulary. I apologize in those cases. Thanks.
